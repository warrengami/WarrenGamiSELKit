           steps: ["Think", "Pair", "Share"],
           timers: [30, 60, 90], // seconds
           prompts: ["What's your perspective?", "What did you learn?"]
       }
   };
   ```

2. **Immediate Feedback Systems:**
   ```javascript
   // Real-time mood and energy tracking
   const feedbackTools = {
       moodCheck: {
           emojis: ["😊", "😐", "😔", "😤", "😌"],
           responses: ["I'm ready to learn!", "I need a break"]
       }
   };
   ```

3. **Water Metaphor Integration:**
   ```javascript
   // Emotional states as water properties
   const waterStates = {
       calm: "Still water",
       excited: "Bubbling water", 
       frustrated: "Turbulent water",
       peaceful: "Flowing water"
   };
   ```

### **Phase 4: Scalability Enhancements (Week 4)**
**Goal:** Ensure system scales across different contexts

#### **Scalability Features:**

1. **Modular Experience System:**
   - Plug-and-play experience types
