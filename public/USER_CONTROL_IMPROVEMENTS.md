# User Control and Feedback Improvements

## Overview
Implemented enhanced user control and feedback mechanisms for the "Blank Dice" and "Blank Scenario Cards" pages to provide better user experience and data persistence awareness.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Saved Indicator System**
- **Visual Feedback**: Added a non-intrusive "ðŸ’¾ Saved!" indicator that appears briefly after user edits
- **Positioning**: Fixed position in top-right corner with smooth fade-in/fade-out animation
- **Timing**: Shows for 2 seconds after the last edit, with 500ms debouncing to prevent spam
- **Styling**: Consistent with toolkit design using sky-blue background and white text

### 2. **Enhanced Data Persistence**
- **Blank Dice**: Already had localStorage implementation, enhanced with saved indicator
- **Blank Scenario Cards**: Implemented complete localStorage solution to save user-generated content
- **Automatic Saving**: Content is saved automatically as users type
- **Data Recovery**: Content is restored when users return to the page

### 3. **Explicit Data Persistence Messaging**
- **Clear Communication**: Added prominent messaging that content is "automatically saved in your browser"
- **User Reassurance**: Helps users understand their work won't be lost
- **Consistent Placement**: Message appears below the main title on both pages

## Technical Implementation

### Saved Indicator CSS
```css
.saved-indicator {
    position: fixed;
    top: 20px;
    right: 20px;
    background-color: var(--sky-blue);
    color: white;
    padding: 8px 16px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
    font-size: 12px;
    font-weight: 600;
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(-10px);
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
    z-index: 1000;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
}
.saved-indicator.show {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
}
```

### JavaScript Implementation
- **Debouncing**: Prevents indicator spam during rapid typing
- **localStorage Keys**: 
  - `selToolkit-blankDicePrompts` for dice content
  - `selToolkit-blankScenarioCards` for scenario content
- **Event Listeners**: Automatically attached to all contenteditable elements
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if localStorage is unavailable

### User Experience Benefits

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Users see their work is being saved
2. **Data Security**: No risk of losing work when closing tabs
3. **Professional Feel**: Consistent with modern web app expectations
4. **Accessibility**: Clear visual feedback for all users
5. **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't interfere with the editing experience
